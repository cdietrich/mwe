# ATTENTION! 
# please modify the build.properties to reflect your local environment.
# The build.proerties will be used to materialize the target platform and to configure local build.

*Local Workspace Setup*
1) change build.properties (uncomment JAVA_HOME properties etc. appropriate for our platform)
2) execute team/setupworkspace.xml

 It will download all the required target platform libraries and extract them to targetplatform/.
 You'll have to point your PDE tooling to the materialized target platform, by using the 
 corresponding preference page (type 'Target Platform' into the search field).
 Add a new definition, start with 'nothing' and add aa 'Directory' location
 pointing to ${workspace_loc}/<releng-project>/team/targetplatform/eclipse
 
3) Import Team project set from team/projectset/extssh/projectset.psf
